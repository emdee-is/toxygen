# Toxygen ToDo List

## Fix history

The code is in there but it's not working.

## Fix Audio

The code is in there but it's not working.
I may have broken it trying to wire up the ability to
set the audio device from the command line.

## Fix Video

The code is in there but it's not working.
I may have broken it trying to wire up the ability to
set the audio device from the command line.

## Group peer_id

There has been a change of API on a field named group.peer_id
The code is broken in places because I have not seen the path
to change from the old API ro the new one.

## Plugin system

Needs better documentation and checking.
There's something broken in the way some of them plug into Qt menus.

Should the plugins be in toxygen or a separate repo?

## check toxygen_wrapper

I've broken out toxygen_wrapper to be standalone,
https://git.plastiras.org/emdee/toxygen_wrapper
but the tox.py needs each call double checking.
